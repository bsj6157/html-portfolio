<h2>My Life</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Early times</li>
<p>I was born the son of a baker. I grew up in a bakery that belonged to my father.<br/>
     It was called Johnson's Pastry Shoppe<br>
The bakery was in Atchison Kansas, just across the Missouri River.<br/>
I grew up with four sisters. I would go hunting with dad on the wooded bluffs of the Missouri River. <br/>
Sometimes for phesant, sometimes for squrrels/rabbits<br/>
 Other times for mushrooms that we fried like cucumbers or tomatos.<br/>
 I played most of the sports up to Jr. H.S.,<br/>
  When I choose solo sports like golf, tennis and racquetball (games you do not play with a team).
